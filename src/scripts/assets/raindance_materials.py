"""Deterministic original Raindance surfaces: rain-darkened highland
concrete and slate. No reference images are sampled.

Kit slots repainted for this pack (rock, soil, sky, water, bark and leaf keep
the kit's original highland set):
  meadow    wet highland grass: isotropic tufts and clover patches, no
            directional streaks (the kit's meadow banded along one axis)
  moss      dark damp moss in the same isotropic style
  concrete  board-formed concrete with rain streaks and a damp lower band
  panel     slate roof and deck plates with drainage seams
  grate     galvanised grating for ramps and hall floors
  trim      dark oiled steel for frames, bands and fittings
  ember / glacier  team enamel panels with a chevron stripe
  light     cool lamp glow: a smooth lit diffuser panel, bright at its centre
            line and soft at the edges (the map shader has no emissive term;
            the old version read as a checkerboard)

Textures tile every 4 m (64 px per metre); walls use u along the wall and
v up the wall, so vertical streaks read as rain run-off.
