"""Original terrain for Ozarktic Blast (docs/ozarktic-blast.md).

Generated only from PeakRunner's own hash noise (shared with Tower Complex's
terrain module) and authored shapes; no heightfield from any other game is
read, resampled, traced or fitted. The layout idea follows a privately
studied reference (Drydock): a ridge astride the flag line, high ground on
one side, a low dock valley on the other. Its heights and positions were
measured as statistics only; the shapes and numbers here are our own, at our
own scale.

Flag axis is world Z (Ember at low Z); the flags lie on the line x = 1024.
- The west is high ground: a broad rounded upland rising away from the
  flag line (on your right as you face the enemy from Ember).
- The Ridge crosses the flag line at the centre: a spur off the west upland
  with a small flat top about 95 m over the flags and a steep east face.
- The east is a low valley holding the two dry docks, one per half, then a
  rim of hills at the east edge where the sniper's perch stands.
- The flags sit on low ground with a gentle rise behind each.

The large forms mirror front to back (z -> 2048 - z), so neither team has
the better ground; the surface detail is not mirrored, so the land still
reads as natural. Structures sit in "sites": the ground is blended toward an
authored surface around each one. Terrain holes sit only under structures.
